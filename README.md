# Excel sheet of timetable â†’ ICS file

## Usage

1. Edit `sample.xlsx`. University of Nottingham students can copy from [Teaching Timetables](https://timetabling.nottingham.ac.uk/) (select 'Autumn Semester' / 'Spring Semester' and 'List View').

2. Make sure `first_sunday` defined in `main.py` is the same as the last Sunday before the first week of the semester.
3. Run `pip install pandas ics && python3 main.py` and get your `sample.ics` file.
4. Upload the ICS file to your calendar.
