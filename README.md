# Excel sheet of timetable â†’ ICS file

## Usage

1. Edit `sample.xlsx`. University of Nottingham students can copy from [Teaching Timetables](https://timetabling.nottingham.ac.uk/) (select 'Autumn Semester' / 'Spring Semester' and 'List View'). Make sure each row has the same format as the sample rows. Delete sample rows, empty rows, rows containing only the day of week, and redundant headers. Tip: please make sure all entries are in the **'text'** format (in Microsoft Excel, select all cells => right click => format cells => select "text" from categories).
2. Make sure `first_sunday` defined in `main.py` is the same as the last Sunday before the first week of the semester; also change `local_tz` if needed.
3. Run `pip install pandas openpyxl ics && python3 main.py` and get your `sample.ics` file.
4. Upload the ICS file to your calendar. Tip: you might want to create a separate calendar and import to it, so that in case you find anything wrong you can delete the whole calendar and start all over again.
